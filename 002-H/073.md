# _redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired() will always overwithdraw from money market tokens, leading to losing some opportunities to earn from  the money markets (losing of funds).

## Summary
``_redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired()`` will always overwithdraw from money market tokens, leading to losing some opportunities to earn from  the money markets (losing of funds).

## Vulnerability Detail
``_redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired()`` is used to redeem money market tokens in order to gain sufficient underlying to withdraw from the contract. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L256-L278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L256-L278)

The function will return immediately if there is sufficient balance of the underlying to withdraw from the contract (``withdrawAmountExternal <= currentBalance``). However, if the balance of the underlying is not sufficient, the function is supposed to withdraw ``withdrawAmountExternal - currentBalance`` from the money markets. The problem is that the function attempts to withdraw ``withdrawAmountExternal `` from the money markets instead. Such overwithdrawl will lose some opportunities for investments.

For example, suppose ``currentBalance = 100,000,000`` and ``withdrawAmountExternal = 100,000,000-1``; instead of only withdrawing 1 from money markets to make up for the deficit, the function will withdraw another 100,000,000 from the money markets, which is way too much withdrawal. 

## Impact
``_redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired()`` will always overwithdraw from money market tokens, leading to losing some opportunities to earn from  the money markets (losing of funds).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When the balance of the underlying is not sufficient, we just need to withdraw ``withdrawAmountExternal - currentBalance`` from money markets. 

```diff
function _redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired(
        uint16 currencyId,
        Token memory underlying,
        uint256 withdrawAmountExternal
    ) private {
        // If there is sufficient balance of the underlying to withdraw from the contract
        // immediately, just return.
        mapping(address => uint256) storage store = LibStorage.getStoredTokenBalances();
        uint256 currentBalance = store[underlying.tokenAddress];
        if (withdrawAmountExternal <= currentBalance) return;

        IPrimeCashHoldingsOracle oracle = PrimeCashExchangeRate.getPrimeCashHoldingsOracle(currencyId);
        // Redemption data returns an array of contract calls to make from the Notional proxy (which
        // is holding all of the money market tokens).
-        (RedeemData[] memory data) = oracle.getRedemptionCalldata(withdrawAmountExternal);
+        (RedeemData[] memory data) = oracle.getRedemptionCalldata(withdrawAmountExternal - currentBalance);


        // This is the total expected underlying that we should redeem after all redemption calls
        // are executed.
        uint256 totalUnderlyingRedeemed = executeMoneyMarketRedemptions(underlying, data);

        // Ensure that we have sufficient funds before we exit
        require(withdrawAmountExternal <= currentBalance.add(totalUnderlyingRedeemed)); // dev: insufficient redeem
    }
```
