# excess ETH isn't returned in safeBatchTransferFrom() function.

## Summary
safeBatchTransferFrom() function is payable.

## Vulnerability Detail
safeBatchTransferFrom() function is payable which means it can receive ETH.

but there's no check to ensure that every amount corresponds with msg.value, so therefore the safeBatchTransferFrom() function
can receive excess ETH.

here's what the check should look like:
```solidity
require(amount==msg.value, `excess ETH`);
```

But the  main issue here now is that the excess ETH isn't returned back.
like in a scenario where amounts[] contains values < msg.value

`msg.value-amount` should be returned.

## Impact
excess ETH isn't returned in safeBatchTransferFrom() function.

## Recommendation
implement a check to automatically send back excess ETH in safeBatchTransferFrom() function.
