# Vault secondary currencies can be fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

When creating or configuring a vault, the vault does not check that the secondary currencies are not fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional-0xleastwood/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultConfiguration.sol#L197

```solidity
File: VaultConfiguration.sol
194:         // Tokens with transfer fees create lots of issues with vault mechanics, we prevent them
195:         // from being listed here.
196:         Token memory underlyingToken = TokenHandler.getUnderlyingToken(vaultConfig.borrowCurrencyId);
197:         require(!underlyingToken.hasTransferFee); 
```

Tokens with transfer fees create lots of issues with vault mechanics. When creating or configuring a vault, Notional explicitly performs validation against the primary currency to ensure that its underlying token does not have a transfer fee at Line 197 above.

However, a vault does not only supports the primary currency. It also supports one or more secondary currencies. When configuring the vault, it should also check that the underlying token of secondary currencies does not have a transfer fee.

## Impact

Tokens with transfer fees create lots of issues with vault mechanics. If a fee-on-transfer token is added as the secondary currency on a vault, the vault might not work or might cause accounting issues within the vault.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking that the underlying token of secondary currencies does not have a transfer fee.

```diff
// Tokens with transfer fees create lots of issues with vault mechanics, we prevent them
// from being listed here.
Token memory underlyingToken = TokenHandler.getUnderlyingToken(vaultConfig.borrowCurrencyId);
require(!underlyingToken.hasTransferFee); 

+ if (vaultConfig.secondaryBorrowCurrencies[0] != 0) {
+	Token memory secondaryUnderlyingTokenOne = TokenHandler.getUnderlyingToken(vaultConfig.secondaryBorrowCurrencies[0]);
+	require(!secondaryUnderlyingTokenOne.hasTransferFee); 
+ }

+ if (vaultConfig.secondaryBorrowCurrencies[1] != 0) {
+	Token memory secondaryUnderlyingTokenTwo = TokenHandler.getUnderlyingToken(vaultConfig.secondaryBorrowCurrencies[1]);
+	require(!secondaryUnderlyingTokenTwo.hasTransferFee); 
+ }
```
