# Potential Integer Overflow in _encodeLendBorrowTrade

## Summary

An integer overflow might occur in the _encodeLendBorrowTrade function due to the lack of input validation for slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the _encodeLendBorrowTrade function, the slippage parameter is cast to a uint256 and shifted by 120 bits. If slippage is a large value, this might cause an integer overflow, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Impact

An integer overflow might lead to incorrect calculations and undesired results, compromising the integrity of the contract and potentially causing financial losses for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation to ensure that slippage does not cause an integer overflow. Consider using SafeMath or similar libraries to perform arithmetic operations safely.
