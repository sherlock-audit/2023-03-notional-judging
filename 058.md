# Invalid Deployment variable constants

## Summary

Deployments variables are currently set to constants that can cause problems if forgotten to be changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

`_setPrimeSettlementRate()`  has a requirement:

`require(Deployments.NOTIONAL_V2_FINAL_SETTLEMENT < maturity); *// dev: final settlement*`

However, the final `NOTIONAL_V2_FINAL_SETTLEMENT` is hardcoded to 0, which means that this check will always succeed.

This means that assets can be settled prior to this date, even when the notional v3 upgrade is enabled.

Also, `WETH` variable is set to Ethereum address. In your blog post, you indicate plans to deploy to Arbitrum. 

## Impact

- Assets can be settled prior to Notional V3 upgrade.
- Arbitrum uses invalid WETH contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// TODO: this will be set to the timestamp of the final settlement time in notional v2,
// no assets can be settled prior to this date once the notional v3 upgrade is enabled.
uint256 internal constant NOTIONAL_V2_FINAL_SETTLEMENT = 0;
```

```solidity
require(Deployments.NOTIONAL_V2_FINAL_SETTLEMENT < maturity); // dev: final settlement
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It would make sense to have a deployment script that inputs these parameters to contracts. For instance, in the `MigratePrimeCash.sol`. Otherwise you might miss this TODO prior to deployment, or use invalid `WETH` contract
