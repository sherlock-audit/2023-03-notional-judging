# BaseERC4626 does not round up for previewMint/previewWithdraw

## Summary

BaseERC4626 does not round up for previewMint/previewWithdraw

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC4626 standard requires `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw` functions functions to round up.

Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations ([https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626))

> Finally, ERC-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:
> 
- If (1) it's calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it's determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round *down*.
- If (1) it's calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it's calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round *up*.

Thus, the result of the `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw` should be rounded up.

## Impact

The function does not round up the result of the conversion, which could lead to loss of funds for users who expect to receive a certain amount of assets when they mint a certain number of shares. 

This issue could be exploited by attackers who could mint shares without receiving the expected amount of assets in return, leading to financial loss for users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Deposits are based on the conversion rate assets to shares
function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) external override view returns (uint256 shares) {
    return convertToShares(assets);
}

/// @notice Mints are based on the conversion rate from shares to assets
function previewMint(uint256 shares) public override view returns (uint256 assets) {
    return convertToAssets(shares);
}

/// @notice Converts nToken denomination to underlying denomination
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public override view returns (uint256 assets) {
    return exchangeRate().mul(shares).div(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend that the `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw` function be updated to comply with the ERC4626 standard and round up the result of the conversion.
