# In AcccountActions.sol, critical functions like depositUnderlyingToken(), depositAssetToken(), withdraw(), nTokenRedeem() functions doesn't have pause/unpause protection in the event of emergency

## Summary
In AcccountActions.sol, critical functions like depositUnderlyingToken(), depositAssetToken(), withdraw(), nTokenRedeem() functions doesn't have pause/unpause protection in the event of emergency
## Vulnerability Detail
Pause/unpause  protection is a very necessary protection to have in the event of emergency as it will help the protocol to bring things to  a standstill till things are rectified. E.g an attempted hack by a malicious user or in a case of a zero-day discovered vuln e.t.c
## Impact
in the event of emergency or hack, contract can not be halted for certain period of time until issues are resolved. 
One of the real life example is **Thor chain** attack. The Thor chain's team noticed an attack was going to occur well before the system transferred funds to the hacker, but they were not able to shut the system down fast enough.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest the team adds pause/unpause modifier to protect the protocol from bad incidents.
