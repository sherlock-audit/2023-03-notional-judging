# ``setBalanceStorageForfCashLiquidation()`` checks the newCashBalance instead of the oldCashBalance to enforce the no-further-debt constraint, as a result, the function might revert even when oldCashBalance > 0.

## Summary
``setBalanceStorageForfCashLiquidation()`` checks the ``newCashBalance`` instead of the oldCashBalance to enforce the no-further-debt constraint, as a result, the function might revert even when ``oldCashBalance > 0``.

## Vulnerability Detail

``setBalanceStorageForfCashLiquidation()`` is used during fCashLiquidation to set new balances in the storage:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/BalanceHandler.sol#L251-L288](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/BalanceHandler.sol#L251-L288)

One requirement here, specified in L262 is: "If a cash balance is negative already we cannot put an account further into debt. In this case the netCashChange must be positive so that it is coming out of debt."

That means, we need to check the ``oldCashBalance`` to enforce the constraint. Unfortunately, the function checks the ``newCashBalance`` instead:

```javascript
 if (newCashBalance < 0) {
            require(netPrimeCashChange > 0, "Neg Cash");
            // NOTE: HAS_CASH_DEBT cannot be extinguished except by a free collateral check
            // where all balances are examined. In this case the has cash debt flag should
            // already be set (cash balances cannot get more negative) but we do it again
            // here just to be safe.
            accountContext.hasDebt = accountContext.hasDebt | Constants.HAS_CASH_DEBT;
        }
```

This means, even when the old cash balance is positive, if the ``newCashBalance < 0``, it is still not allowed. In other words, one can never bring the cashBalance from positive to negative during ``fcash`` liquidation. 


## Impact
``setBalanceStorageForfCashLiquidation()`` checks the newCashBalance instead of the oldCashBalance to enforce the no-further-debt constraint, as a result, the function might revert even when oldCashBalance > 0.
