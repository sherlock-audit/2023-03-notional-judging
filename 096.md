# initialize(address owner_, address pauseRouter_, address pauseGuardian_)

## Summary
It is important to note that this function is missing a modifier that restricts access to the DEPLOYER role, which could potentially allow other parties to call this function and perform the initialization. A best practice is to use a modifier, such as onlyOwner, to restrict access to the owner of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call the initialize function more than once, allowing the owner or pause settings to be overwritten
## Impact
high - missing access control
