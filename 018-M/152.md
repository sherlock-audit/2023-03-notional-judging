# The nTokenTransferApproveAll() function in nTokenAction.sol doesn't give spender any allowance

## Summary
The nTokenTransferApproveAll() function in nTokenAction.sol doesn't give `spender` any allowance

## Vulnerability Detail
The nTokenTransferApproveAll() function in nTokenAction.sol doesn't give spender any allowance, it just adds spender to nToken's whitelist.
but since a user should be able to approve all token transfers to an external exchange or protocol in a single txn with this function i think its supposed to give allowances which it doesn't.

i mean something like this:
```solidity
        nTokenAllowance[tokenHolder][spender][currencyId] = amount;
```

## Impact

Approve functions are functions used to give allowances. But this function doesn't do that
The nTokenTransferApproveAll() function in nTokenAction.sol doesn't approve anything it just adds spender to nTokenWhitelist.

The nTokenTransferApproveAll() doesn't approve token transfers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
correct it to something like this
```solidity
   function nTokenTransferApproveAll(address spender, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool) {
        nTokenWhitelist[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        nTokenAllowance[msg.sender][spender][ntoken.address] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
