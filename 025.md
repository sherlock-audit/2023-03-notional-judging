# when liquidating accounts via `deleverageAccount()` function and `liquidateVaultCashBalance()` function there is no check to make sure `vault address` isn't passed into the `Account` parameter.

## Summary
when liquidating accounts via `deleverageAccount()` function there is no check to make sure `vault address` isn't passed into the `Account` parameter. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Both `delevergeAccount()` function and `liquidateVaultCashBalance()` function call `_authenticateDeleverage()` function which has several checks for input validation but the check to ensure `vault address` isn't used as `Account` is missing, meaning `vault address` can be passed into the `Account` argument
## Impact
passing the `vault address` into the `Account` argument when using delevergeAccount() function to liquidate or using liquidateVaultCashBalance() function to liquidate an account that has a cash balance will cause severe issues for both the users and the protocol.
