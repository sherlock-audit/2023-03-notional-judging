# These functions `updateVault()`, `updateSecondaryBorrowCapacity()`, `setMaxBorrowCapacity()`, lacks check to ensure that address passed into the `vaultAddress` argument is an actual vault and non-disabled vault.

## Summary
These functions `updateVault()`, `updateSecondaryBorrowCapacity()`, `setMaxBorrowCapacity()`, lacks check to ensure that address passed into the `vaultAddress` argument is an actual vault and non-disabled vault.

as they all lack this check:
```solidity
require(vaultConfig.getFlag(VaultConfiguration.ENABLED));
```


## Vulnerability Detail
There is a possible scenario in `updateVault()` where a non-existing vault address can be set with an actual vault's config here:
```solidity
VaultConfiguration.setVaultConfig(vaultAddress, vaultConfig);
```
That won't be good. Also a disabled vault can be re-enabled via the updateVault().

Also here in updateSecondaryBorrowCapacity() function a Secondary borrow currency can be whitelisted for a non-existing vault or disabled vault.
```solidity
VaultConfig memory vaultConfig = VaultConfiguration.getVaultConfigStateful(vaultAddress);
```
as there is no check to make sure that vaultAddress is an actual vault and non-disabled vault.

## Impact
non-existing vaults can be used with these functions causing inefficiencies for both users and the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pls add this checks to this functions
```solidity
require(vaultConfig.getFlag(VaultConfiguration.ENABLED));
```
since the vaultAddress to be passed in here is an existing vault.
