# Storage slot used during migration might result in storage collision

## Summary

Storage collision might occur on the storage slot used during the migration if future iterations of Notional read or write to that slot.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/patchfix/MigratePrimeCash.sol#L66

```solidity
File: MigratePrimeCash.sol
40: contract MigratePrimeCash is BasePatchFixRouter, StorageLayoutV2 {
..SNIP..
66:     mapping(uint256 => MigrationSettings) internal _migrationSettings;
```

Let $x$ be the last storage slot of `StorageLayoutV2`. During migration, the implementation of the Notional proxy is temporarily switched to `MigratePrimeCash` contract. 

The `MigratePrimeCash` contract introduces an additional mapping `_migrationSettings` at the storage slot $x+1$ to keep track of some migration data. The `_migrationSettings` mapping is not used after the migration.

However, the problem is that in the future iteration of Notional, if any of the contracts use slot $x + 1$, it will lead to storage collision and corrupted data might be read from slot $x + 1$.

## Impact

If corrupted data is read from the slot where old data exists, this could lead to unexpected behavior. If the storage collision affects a slot that stores critical data, such as the address of an owner or admin of a contract or the balance of a particular user, it might potentially result in the loss of assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using an unstructured storage pattern for storing migration data or create a new `StorageLayoutV3` to keep track of the storage slot used by `_migrationSettings` mapping to avoid potential storage collision in the future.
