# Underlying delta is calculated on internal token balance

## Summary

The underlying delta is calculated on the internal token balance, which might cause inconsistency with tokens of varying decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: TreasuryAction.sol
284:     function _executeRebalance(uint16 currencyId) private {
285:         IPrimeCashHoldingsOracle oracle = PrimeCashExchangeRate.getPrimeCashHoldingsOracle(currencyId);
286:         uint8[] memory rebalancingTargets = _getRebalancingTargets(currencyId, oracle.holdings());
287:         (RebalancingData memory data) = REBALANCING_STRATEGY.calculateRebalance(oracle, rebalancingTargets);
288: 
289:         (/* */, uint256 totalUnderlyingValueBefore) = oracle.getTotalUnderlyingValueStateful();
290: 
291:         // Process redemptions first
292:         Token memory underlyingToken = TokenHandler.getUnderlyingToken(currencyId);
293:         TokenHandler.executeMoneyMarketRedemptions(underlyingToken, data.redeemData);
294: 
295:         // Process deposits
296:         _executeDeposits(underlyingToken, data.depositData);
297: 
298:         (/* */, uint256 totalUnderlyingValueAfter) = oracle.getTotalUnderlyingValueStateful();
299: 
300:         int256 underlyingDelta = totalUnderlyingValueBefore.toInt().sub(totalUnderlyingValueAfter.toInt());
301:         require(underlyingDelta.abs() < Constants.REBALANCING_UNDERLYING_DELTA);
302:     }
```

The `underlyingDelta` is denominated in internal token precision (1e8) and is computed by taking the difference between `totalUnderlyingValueBefore` and `totalUnderlyingValueAfter` in Line 300 above.

Next, the `underlyingDelta` is compared against the `Constants.REBALANCING_UNDERLYING_DELTA` (10_000=0.0001) to ensure that the rebalance did not exceed the acceptable delta threshold.

However, the same `Constants.REBALANCING_UNDERLYING_DELTA` is used across all tokens such as ETH, DAI, and USDC. As a result, the delta will not be consistent with tokens of varying decimals.

## Impact

Using the internal token precision (1e8) might result in an over-sensitive trigger for tokens with fewer decimals (e.g. 1e6) as they are scaled up and an under-sensitive one for tokens with more decimals (e.g. 1e18) as they are scaled down, leading to inconsistency across different tokens when checking against the `Constants.REBALANCING_UNDERLYING_DELTA`.

This also means that the over-sensitive one will trigger a revert more easily and vice versa.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using the external token balance and scale `Constants.REBALANCING_UNDERLYING_DELTA` to the token's decimals.
