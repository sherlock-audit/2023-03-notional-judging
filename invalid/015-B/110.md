# Migration can be frontrunned

## Summary
Due to the inherent limitations in automating the settling of negative cash debts, there's a potential for front-running attacks during the migration process. An attacker could intentionally make their stored cash balance negative, consequently disrupting the migration process and posing a significant risk to its successful completion.
## Vulnerability Detail
The process of settling negative cash debts primarily falls under the domain of governance and can't be entirely automated or executed on-chain. This scenario presents an opportunity for a potential exploit. A front-running attacker could theoretically discern the migration transaction and manipulate it to their advantage. They could do this by borrowing a certain amount, thereby causing their stored cash balance to become negative. This could disrupt the migration process and compromise its success.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Notional V2 is not in this contest scope but I am assuming that negative cash balance means == borrowed funds, if there are some borrowed funds than that should basically means someone is having a negative cash balance. It could be a good check to see if there are any borrowed positions inside the _patchFix() function.
