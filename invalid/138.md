# Must approve by zero first

## Summary
The protocol currently uses any tokens:

>  ERC20: any (USDC, DAI, USDT, ETH, stETH, etc)

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens will revert when updating allowance. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.
## Impact
The protocol will impossible to use USDT.
