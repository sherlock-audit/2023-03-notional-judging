# Force account settlement during migration make user loss money, especially the leverage vault settlement

## Summary

Force account settlement during migration make user loss money, especially the leverage vault settlement

## Vulnerability Detail

Per https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2chGQ3TMxxhAweZ7OkBQtTWDp0iP2GOeEAPpJrey2E/edit

migration note:

> References to the previous settlement rates are no longer in the code. Prior to settlement, all accounts that have not been settled must be settled or they will not be able to settle in Notional V3. The Notional team will proactively settle all existing accounts with a minimum dust balance prior to migration.

However, force settlement can make user lose money if the account is far away from maturity

also, this approach lack of consideration for user that take leverage position using leverage vault

and all settled accounts on the vault must exit and if protocol forrce exit for user

the user can lose money as well

Per 

https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v2/leveraged-vaults/entering-and-exiting-a-vault

> Exit

> Users can exit a vault at any time, either before or after their debt matures. If the user exits prior to the maturity of their debt, Notional will redeem the user's vault shares, pay off their debt by lending to the specified liquidity pool at the current market rate, and return the excess capital to the user.

However, the current market rate may just not favorable to user and make them lose money and it is possible the leverage position is in a loss and there is no excess capital returned for user!


## Impact

protocol failed to force user exit if there are just not enough liquidity to lend to pay for the leverage vault fee or the user is forced to exit and settle at a loss position!

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol design an alternate mechanism, for example, have user re-open the position after the migration period
