# Non-standard ERC-4626 vault functionality

## Summary
There are multiple locations in the ERC-4626 BaseVault that do not conform to [ERC-4626 specifications](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)

## Vulnerability Detail
- maxDeposit does not return 0 when deposits are disabled.
- maxMint does not return 0 when withdrawals are disabled.
- maxWithdraw does not return 0 when withdrawals are disabled.

As per the documentation provided, 

> Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?

> A: Yes. The Notional V3 Proxy should adhere to ERC1155 for fCash and vault tokens. Note that fCash is transferrable, while Vault tokens are not. Events for both fCash and Vault tokens should be properly emitted from Notional V3. Balances for both fCash and vault tokens should be query-able via Notional V3.
**The Notional V3 proxy will also deploy ERC20/ERC4626 compatible proxies for Prime Cash, nTokens and Prime Debt. All three should emit proper Transfer events for mints, burns and transfers.** Existing Notional V2 nToken proxies do not emit proper Transfer events and cannot be upgraded. Full ERC4626 compatibility is not in this version (deposit, mint, withdraw, redeem are not fully functional) but view methods are implemented.


## Impact
This can cause any components that rely on any of these functions to return a correct value to malfunction.

So, maxWithdraw, maxDeposit and maxMint should return the value 0 when deposits are paused or processing.
See a similar issue [M-05](https://github.com/pods-finance/yield-contracts/blob/main/audits/2022-12-02_OpenZeppelin_Pods.pdf) reported by OpenZeppelin in a protocol implementing the ERC-4626 standard.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider correcting the above issues to meet the ERC-4626 specifications, allowing future vault developers to expect certain protocol behaviors.
