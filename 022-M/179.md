# Inconsistent use of `VAULT_ACCOUNT_MIN_TIME` in vault implementation

## Summary

There is a considerable difference in implementation behaviour when a vault has yet to mature compared to after vault settlement.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is some questionable functionality with the following `require` statement:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional-0xleastwood/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/VaultAccountAction.sol#L242

```solidity
File: VaultAccountAction.sol
242:     require(vaultAccount.lastUpdateBlockTime + Constants.VAULT_ACCOUNT_MIN_TIME <= block.timestamp)
```

The `lastUpdateBlockTime` variable is updated in _two_ cases:
 - A user enters a vault position, updating the vault state; including `lastUpdateBlockTime`. This is a proactive measure to prevent users from quickly entering and exiting the vault.
 - The vault has matured and as a result, each time vault fees are assessed for a given vault account, `lastUpdateBlockTime` is updated to `block.timestamp` after calculating the pro-rated fee for the prime cash vault.

Therefore, before a vault has matured, it is not possible to quickly enter and exit a vault. But after `Constants.VAULT_ACCOUNT_MIN_TIME` has passed, the user can exit the vault as many times as they like. However, the same does not hold true once a vault has matured. Each time a user exits the vault, they must wait `Constants.VAULT_ACCOUNT_MIN_TIME` time again to re-exit. This seems like inconsistent behaviour.

## Impact

The `exitVault()` function will ultimately affect prime and non-prime vault users differently. It makes sense for the codebase to be written in such a way that functions execute in-line with user expectations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It might be worth adding an exception to `VaultConfiguration.settleAccountOrAccruePrimeCashFees()` so that when vault fees are calculated, `lastUpdatedBlockTime` is not updated to `block.timestamp`.
