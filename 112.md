# nTokenTransferApprove and nTokenTransferFrom functions of n tokens are subject to front-run attack.

## Summary
nTokenTransferApprove and nTokenTransferFrom functions of Pool tokens are subject to front-run attack because the nTokenTransferApprove method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. In case the spender spent the amonut, the nTokenTransferApprove function will approve a new amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `nTokenTransferApprove()` method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. It allows the spender to front-run and spend the amount before the new allowance is set.

Scenario:

Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's ntokens (N>0) by calling the `nTokenTransferApprove()` method, passing the Bob's address and N as the method arguments
After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the `nTokenTransferApprove()` method again, this time passing the Bob's address and M as the method arguments
Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the `nTokenTransferFrom()` method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the `nTokenTransferFr()` method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.
So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob. The same issue for `pCashTransferApprove()` and `pCashTransferFrom()` functions.

   function nTokenTransferApprove(
        uint16 currencyId,
        address tokenHolder,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        address nTokenAddress = nTokenHandler.nTokenAddress(currencyId);
        require(msg.sender == nTokenAddress);
        require(tokenHolder != address(0));

        nTokenAllowance[tokenHolder][spender][currencyId] = amount;
        return true;
    }

 function nTokenTransferFrom(
        uint16 currencyId,
        address spender,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        address nTokenAddress = nTokenHandler.nTokenAddress(currencyId);
        require(msg.sender == nTokenAddress);
        require(from != to);
        requireValidAccount(to);

        uint256 allowance = nTokenAllowance[from][spender][currencyId];

        if (allowance > 0) {
            // This is the specific allowance for the nToken.
            require(allowance >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
            // Overflow checked above
            nTokenAllowance[from][spender][currencyId] = allowance - amount;
        } else {
            // This whitelist allowance works across all nTokens
            allowance = nTokenWhitelist[from][spender];
            require(allowance >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
            // Overflow checked above
            nTokenWhitelist[from][spender] = allowance - amount;
        }

        return _transfer(currencyId, from, to, amount, true);
    }

```

## Impact
It can result in losing pool tokens of users when he approve pool tokens to any malicious account.
