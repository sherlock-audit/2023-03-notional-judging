# Secondary debt dust balances are not truncated

## Summary

Dust balances in primary debt are truncated toward zero. However, this truncation was not performed against secondary debts.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional-0xleastwood/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultAccount.sol#L231

```solidity
File: VaultAccount.sol
212:     function updateAccountDebt(
..SNIP..
230:         // Truncate dust balances towards zero
231:         if (0 < vaultState.totalDebtUnderlying && vaultState.totalDebtUnderlying < 10) vaultState.totalDebtUnderlying = 0;
..SNIP..
233:     }
```

`vaultState.totalDebtUnderlying` is primarily used to track the total debt of primary currency. Within the `updateAccountDebt` function, any dust balance in the `vaultState.totalDebtUnderlying` is truncated towards zero at the end of the function as shown above.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional-0xleastwood/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultSecondaryBorrow.sol#L304

```solidity
File: VaultSecondaryBorrow.sol
304:     function _updateTotalSecondaryDebt(
305:         VaultConfig memory vaultConfig,
306:         address account,
307:         uint16 currencyId,
308:         uint256 maturity,
309:         int256 netUnderlyingDebt,
310:         PrimeRate memory pr
311:     ) private {
312:         VaultStateStorage storage balance = LibStorage.getVaultSecondaryBorrow()
313:             [vaultConfig.vault][maturity][currencyId];
314:         int256 totalDebtUnderlying = VaultStateLib.readDebtStorageToUnderlying(pr, maturity, balance.totalDebt);
315:         
316:         // Set the new debt underlying to storage
317:         totalDebtUnderlying = totalDebtUnderlying.add(netUnderlyingDebt);
318:         VaultStateLib.setTotalDebtStorage(
319:             balance, pr, vaultConfig, currencyId, maturity, totalDebtUnderlying, false // not settled
320:         );
```

However, this approach was not consistently applied when handling dust balance in secondary debt within the `_updateTotalSecondaryDebt` function. Within the `_updateTotalSecondaryDebt` function, the dust balance in secondary debts is not truncated.

## Impact

The inconsistency in handling dust balances in primary and secondary debt could potentially lead to discrepancies in debt accounting within the protocol, accumulation of dust, and result in unforeseen consequences.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider truncating dust balance in secondary debt within the `_updateTotalSecondaryDebt` function similar to what has been done for primary debt.
