## Summary
getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal(uint16 currencyId, uint256 borrowedAmountExternal, uint256 maturity, uint32 maxBorrowRate, uint256 blockTime, bool useUnderlying)

## Vulnerability Detail
The function uses the _convertDepositAmountToUnderlyingInternal function, which can lead to integer overflow.

## Recommendation
Use SafeMath or a similar library to perform arithmetic operations and prevent integer overflows, which can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts.
