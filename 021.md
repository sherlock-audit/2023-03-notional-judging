# tokens like usdt must approve 0 first

## Summary
some tokens like USDT must approve 0 first.

I know that currently USDT isn't used... but i think this should be corrected so that the protocol and the users won't have issues with tokens like USDT when it is later introduced.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

## Impact
due to the function approving max multiple times, certain tokens, that only allow a non-zero allowance to be set starting from zero, could revert.

Because this depends on the token implementation, like USDT and similar tokens.
