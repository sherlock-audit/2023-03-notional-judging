# nTokenTransferApprove(), pCashTransferApprove(), nTokenTransferFrom() and pCashTransferFrom()  functions of nTokenAction.sol are subject to front-run attacks

## Summary
`nTokenTransferApprove()`, `pCashTransferApprove()`, `nTokenTransferFrom()` and `pCashTransferFrom()` functions of nTokenAction.sol  are subject to front-run attacks because the approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. In case the spender spent the amount, the approve function will approve a new amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not. It allows the spender to front-run and spend the amount before the new allowance is set.

Scenario:

- Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's tokens (N>0) by calling the nTokenAction.nTokenTransferApprove() / nTokenAction.pCashTransferApprove() method, passing the `currencyId`, her address(tokenHolder), Bob's address and N as the method arguments

- After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the nTokenAction.nTokenTransferApprove() / nTokenAction.pCashTransferApprove() method again, this time passing the`currencyId`, her address(tokenHolder), Bob's address and M as the method arguments
 
- Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the nTokenAction.nTokenTransferFrom() / nTokenAction.pCashTransferFrom() method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
 
- If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
 
- Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the nTokenAction.nTokenTransferFrom() / nTokenAction.pCashTransferFrom() method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.
 
- So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.
 

## Impact
It can result in losing tokens of users when they approve tokens to any malicious account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement them in such a way they work like OZ's increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance instead of approve as OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. Please see details here:
