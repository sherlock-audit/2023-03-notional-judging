# Malicious users can manipulate oracle rate in InterestRateCurve#updateRateOracle()

## Summary
Malicious users can manipulate oracle rate in InterestRateCurve#updateRateOracle(). The main problem is that the new oracle rate is simply a combination of ``lastInterestRate`` and ``oracleRatePrevious`` and if no one trades within ``rateOracleTimeWindow``,  ``lastInterestRate`` becomes the new oracle rate. That is, it only relies on ``lastInterestRate``.

## Vulnerability Detail

updateRateOracle() uses a lagged weighted average over a short term price window to calculate the new oracle rate: 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/InterestRateCurve.sol#L202-L228](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/InterestRateCurve.sol#L202-L228)

However, the new oracle rate relies ONLY on ``lastInterestRate`` and ``oracleRatePrevious`` and the time that has elapsed. We show how a malicious user might be able to manipulate the oracle rate as follows: 

1. Suppose ``oracleRatePrevious = 5%``. A malicious user can dump much cash into the market using a flash loan and depress interest rates to ``lastInterestRate`` = 2%. 

4. Wait for ``rateOracleTimeWindow``, if no one trades during this period, then the new oracle rate automatically becomes 2%. The malicious user can then take advantage of this to liquidate some accounts to profit.

5. If there are some other trades during the ``rateOracleTimeWindow`` period, then the malicious user goes back to step 1. In other words, the malicious user backruns any trade with flashloan dump trade  to ensure ``lastInterestRate`` = 2%. 

6. Since the malicious user always backrun each trade with a flashloan dump during  the ``rateOracleTimeWindow`` period, there is a guarantee that after the ``rateOracleTimeWindow`` period, the new oracle rate will become 2% and the malicious user can liquidate other accounts.

## Impact
Malicious users can manipulate oracle rate in InterestRateCurve#updateRateOracle() and liquidate other accounts to profit.

## Recommendation
Use an idea similar to [TWAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_average_price), so that the oracle rate does not rely on just the last ``lastInterestRate``, but on a time-weighted average of a sequence of oracle rates.
