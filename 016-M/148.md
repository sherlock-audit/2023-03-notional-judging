# There can be excess ETH in depositUnderlyingToken() function and users won't be able to choose if they want the excess ETH returned as WETH

## Summary
The depositUnderlyingToken() function in AccountAction.sol can receive excess ETH

## Vulnerability Detail
1. The depositUnderlyingToken() function fails to check that msg.value is strictly equal to `amountExternalPrecision` with a check like this
```solidity
require(amountExternalPrecision == msg.value, "must correspond!")
```
Now the msg.value can be a completely different value from `amountExternalPrecision`


2. because the function assumes that there won't be excess ETH without enforcing it with a require statement, the function fails to give users the opportuinity to withdraw the excess ETH as WETH.
It is missing this bool
```solidity
 bool returnExcessWrapped
```
## Impact
1. the AccountAction.sol's depositUnderlyingToken() function can receive Excess ETH
2. Users aren't given the opportuinity to withdraw excess ETH as WETH

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. if AccountAction.sol's depositUnderlyingToken() function isn't meant to receive excess ETH pls enforce it by adding this check. (first convert the amountExternalPrecision to a normal value and then use it in the require statement)

```solidity
require(convertedAmountExternalPrecision == msg.value, `must correspond!`)
```

3. or give users the opportuinity to withdraw the excess ETH as WETH by adding this bool
```solidity
 bool returnExcessWrapped
```
