# Failure building the prime rate will prevent liquidations and settlements

## Summary
The prime rate, calculated using the PrimeRate library, is essential for various functions in the Notional Protocol. However, a potential failure in prime rate calculation due to an underflow can cause issues in deposits, withdrawals, nToken actions, liquidations, and settlements. This failure could lead to a catastrophic scenario for the protocol, as it may result in undercollateralization and disastrous consequences for Notional.
## Vulnerability Detail
The prime rate is constructed using the PrimeRate library, which is employed for numerous actions in Notional, such as deposits, withdrawals, nToken actions, liquidations, and settlements. This means that establishing the prime rate is crucial for processing these functions. However, there is a scenario where constructing the prime rate can fail, as described in the protocol here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/pCash/PrimeCashExchangeRate.sol#L559-L571

If the current underlying value is less than the previous underlying value, an underflow will occur, causing the function to revert. The protocol team has commented on the possible cases where this might happen, such as a potential haircut to lenders in certain money market exchanges or miscalculations on the oracle side. As a result of this underflow, building the prime rate becomes impossible. This means that liquidations and settlements cannot proceed, which is a catastrophic scenario for the protocol. Liquidations and settlements should not be affected by this issue. Here's an example scenario where things go awry:

Suppose there is no idle DAI in Notional, and all DAI is in Compound V3, earning additional interest. An exploit occurs, targeting Compound V3, and some funds are stolen, causing the cDAI:DAI ratio to decrease. Now, the current underlying value is less than the previously reported underlying value by Notional. Withdrawals, deposits, and nToken deposits cannot proceed, which is somewhat acceptable. However, liquidations and settlements are also not possible, which should never be acceptable. If liquidations cannot take place at the appropriate time, this will lead to undercollateralization and disastrous consequences for Notional.
## Impact
Although the scenario described above is not everyday thing, it is definitely something can happen in DeFi space. If Notional can't adjust itself to prepare these scenarios Notional will got hurt badly so I will consider this finding as high. 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/BalanceHandler.sol#L525
loadBalanceState from BalanceHandler is almost called anywhere on external actions which builds the prime rate

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
At least for liquidations and settlements, discard the potential failure in prime rate. If the last underlying value is bigger than current then that means there is a loss and account it instead of reverting such that the protocol can work properly. Any losses happens from external money markets or oracle accounting errors should be socialized among prime cash users.
