# Lack of Support for Non-18 Decimal Tokens in Constants Library

## Summary
This bug bounty report outlines a vulnerability related to token decimal precision handling.

## Vulnerability Detail
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/global/Constants.sol#L11)
The code does not explicitly support non-18 decimal tokens, which could lead to unintended behavior or inaccuracies in token calculations. It appears that the code primarily consists of constants and does not actively handle token interactions or calculations. However, if the system interacts with tokens of different decimal precisions without proper consideration, it may result in financial losses or inconsistencies within the system.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability can vary depending on the specific implementation and usage of the code. Potential consequences include:

The impact of this vulnerability can vary depending on the specific implementation and usage of the code. Potential consequences include:

1. Inaccurate token calculations: If tokens with non-18 decimal precisions are used without appropriate modifications, calculations involving token amounts may produce incorrect results. This could lead to incorrect balances, transaction values, or other token-related operations.

2. Financial losses: Inaccurate token calculations could result in financial losses for users or the system itself. If token amounts are miscalculated or mishandled, it may lead to incorrect transfer values, improper fee calculations, or other financial discrepancies.

3. System inconsistencies: Inconsistencies between token decimal precisions may introduce discrepancies within the system. This can affect various processes, including token conversions, collateral calculations, or any functionality relying on precise token amounts.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity >=0.7.6;

// ... (Other code omitted for brevity)

library Constants {
    // Token precision used for all internal balances
    int256 internal constant INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION = 1e8;
    // ETH decimal precision
    uint256 internal constant ETH_DECIMAL_PLACES = 18;

    // ... (Other constants omitted for brevity)
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to carefully review and modify the code to support tokens with decimal precisions other than 18. The following actions are suggested:

Assess token handling requirements: Determine the specific use cases and requirements for interacting with tokens of different decimal precisions within the system.

Modify token calculation logic: Adjust the code to appropriately handle token amounts based on their respective decimal precisions. Ensure that all token calculations, conversions, and interactions account for the correct decimal precision to maintain accuracy.

## Example
```solidity
uint8 internal constant ETH_DECIMAL_PLACES = 8;
```

By making these changes, you'll be able to support tokens with a different number of decimal places in the Constants library.
