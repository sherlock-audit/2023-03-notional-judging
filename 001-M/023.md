# initialize() function in Router.sol Cannot Be Called Once Deployed

## Summary
Once the Router.sol contract is deployed, the initialize() can never be called, hence an owner cannot be set.
## Vulnerability Detail
The initialize() function can only be called when this require statement is fulfilled:
```solidity
require(msg.sender == DEPLOYER && !hasInitialized);
```
However, even if the caller is the **DEPLOYER**, **hasInitialized** can never be false as it has already been set to true during deployment.

```solidity
    constructor(
        DeployedContracts memory contracts
    ) {
        GOVERNANCE = contracts.governance;
        VIEWS = contracts.views;
        INITIALIZE_MARKET = contracts.initializeMarket;
        NTOKEN_ACTIONS = contracts.nTokenActions;
        BATCH_ACTION = contracts.batchAction;
        ACCOUNT_ACTION = contracts.accountAction;
        ERC1155 = contracts.erc1155;
        LIQUIDATE_CURRENCY = contracts.liquidateCurrency;
        LIQUIDATE_FCASH = contracts.liquidatefCash;
        TREASURY = contracts.treasury;
        CALCULATION_VIEWS = contracts.calculationViews;
        VAULT_ACCOUNT_ACTION = contracts.vaultAccountAction;
        VAULT_ACTION = contracts.vaultAction;
        VAULT_LIQUIDATION_ACTION = contracts.vaultLiquidationAction;
        VAULT_ACCOUNT_HEALTH = contracts.vaultAccountHealth;

        DEPLOYER = msg.sender;
        // This will lock everyone from calling initialize on the implementation contract
        hasInitialized = true;
    }
```
## Impact
The initialize() function sets the owner variable as well as the pauseRouter and the pauseGuardian variables. Once the Router.sol contract is deployed, functions that rely on these variables will not work as intended because the initialize() function is never called to set the variables.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting hasInitialized to true when the initialize() function is called, not in the constructor. Or consider not setting the hasInitialized boolean to true in the constructor and calling the initialize() function in the constructor instead.
