# Settling a bitmap account that has debt via settleAccount() function in AccountAction.sol won't clear the `hasDebt` flag

## Summary
Settling a bitmap account that has debt via settleAccount() function in AccountAction.sol won't clear the `hasDebt` flag

## Vulnerability Detail
the settleAccount() function doesn't clear the hasDebt flag for a bitmap account. This will make **bitmap account users pay their debts twice** if they fail to perform the **free collateral check** on their bitmap accounts 

## Impact
Bitmap account users will end up **paying their debts twice** if they use the settleAccount() function in AccountAction.sol to settle their accounts but fail to perform a **free collateral check** on their accounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
put a check to make sure bitmap account users don't have access to settleAccount() function in AccountAction.sol. 
That way a bitmap user won't be able to use the function manually.
