# Possible to liquidate past the debt outstanding above the min borrow without liquidating the entire debt outstanding

## Summary

It is possible to liquidate past the debt outstanding above the min borrow without liquidating the entire debt outstanding. Thus, leaving accounts with small debt that are not profitable to unwind if it needs to liquidate.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultValuation.sol#L251

```solidity
File: VaultValuation.sol
250:         // NOTE: deposit amount is always positive in this method
251:         if (depositUnderlyingInternal < maxLiquidatorDepositLocal) {
252:             // If liquidating past the debt outstanding above the min borrow, then the entire
253:             // debt outstanding must be liquidated.
254: 
255:             // (debtOutstanding - depositAmountUnderlying) is the post liquidation debt. As an
256:             // edge condition, when debt outstanding is discounted to present value, the account
257:             // may be liquidated to zero while their debt outstanding is still greater than the
258:             // min borrow size (which is normally enforced in notional terms -- i.e. non present
259:             // value). Resolving this would require additional complexity for not much gain. An
260:             // account within 20% of the minBorrowSize in a vault that has fCash discounting enabled
261:             // may experience a full liquidation as a result.
262:             require(
263:                 h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex].sub(depositUnderlyingInternal) < minBorrowSize,
264:                 "Must Liquidate All Debt"
265:             );
```

- `depositUnderlyingInternal` is always a positive value (Refer to comment on Line 250) that represents the amount of underlying deposited by the liquidator
- `h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex]` is always a negative value representing debt outstanding of a specific currency in a vault account
- `minBorrowSize` is always a positive value that represents the minimal borrow size of a specific currency (It is stored as uint32 in storage)

If liquidating past the debt outstanding above the min borrow, then the entire debt outstanding must be liquidated.

Assume the following scenario:

- `depositUnderlyingInternal` = `70 USDC`
- `h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex]` = `-100 USDC`
- `minBorrowSize` = `50 USDC`

If the liquidation is successful, the vault account should be left with `-30 USDC` debt outstanding because `70 USDC` has been paid off by the liquidator. However, this should not happen under normal circumstances because the debt outstanding (`-30`) does not meet the minimal borrow size of `50 USDC` and the liquidation should revert/fail.

The following piece of validation logic attempts to ensure that all outstanding debt is liquidated if post-liquidation debt does not meet the minimal borrowing size.

```solidity
require(
    h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex].sub(depositUnderlyingInternal) < minBorrowSize,
    "Must Liquidate All Debt"
);
```

Plugging in the values from our scenario to verify if the code will revert if the debt outstanding does not meet the minimal borrow size.

```solidity
require(
	(-100 USDC - 70 USDC) < 50 USDC
);
===>
require(
	(-170 USDC) < 50 USDC
);
===>
require(true) // no revert
```

The above shows that it is possible for someone to liquidate past the debt outstanding above the min borrow without liquidating the entire debt outstanding. This shows that the math formula in the code is incorrect and not working as intended.

## Impact

A liquidation can bring an account below the minimum debt. Accounts smaller than the minimum debt are not profitable to unwind if it needs to liquidate [(Reference)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultAccount.sol#L329)

As a result, liquidators are not incentivized to liquidate those undercollateralized positions. This might leave the protocol with bad debts, potentially leading to insolvency if the bad debts accumulate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the formula to as follows:

```diff
require(
-   h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex].sub(depositUnderlyingInternal) < minBorrowSize,
+   h.debtOutstanding[currencyIndex].neg().sub(depositUnderlyingInternal) > minBorrowSize,
    "Must Liquidate All Debt"
);
```

Plugging in the values from our scenario again to verify if the code will revert if the debt outstanding does not meet the minimal borrow size.

```solidity
require(
	((-100 USDC).neg() - 70 USDC) > 50 USDC
);
===>
require(
	(100 USDC - 70 USDC) > 50 USDC
);
===>
require(
	(30 USDC) > 50 USDC
);
===>
require(false) // revert
```

The above will trigger a revert as expected when the debt outstanding does not meet the minimal borrow size.
