# COMP tokens can get lost in Treasury

## Summary

COMP tokens can get lost in Treasury. COMP tokens cannot be claimed by the treasury manager contract

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside the function `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer`, compound is claimed by calling the function `Comptroller.claimComp`.

Then the `netBalance` of the COMP token is calculated by subtracting the pre-balance from the post-balance.

A malicious actor can frontrun the call to the function `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer`, claiming COMP tokens by calling the function `Comptroller.claimComp` on behalf of the `TreasuryAction` contract. Then when `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer` is called by the manager contract, `balanceBefore` and `balanceAfter` will be the same value, because `Comptroller.claimComp` was already executed before by the attacker, so the `netBalance` will be 0 at this point and compound is stuck in the treasury.

## Impact

COMP tokens get stuck in the treasury.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to make sure that no COMP tokens can get stuck, consider to transfer the entire COMP token balance of the treasury contract instead of transferring the delta between balanceBefore and balanceAfter.

```solidity
// TreasuryAction.sol

123        uint256 totalBalance = COMP.balanceOf(address(this));
124        if (totalBalance > 0) {
125            COMP.safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalBalance);
```
