# using 1e18 as exchangeRate in BaseERC4626Proxy.sol will cause precision errors when converting to shares and converting to assets for some assets

## Summary
Assuming 1e18, will cause precision loss

## Vulnerability Detail
1e18 is used as exchangeRate in BaseERC4626Proxy.sol, but some tokens decimals aren't 18 decimals.. like  WBTC which has 8 decimals and USDC on ARBITRUM which has 6 decimals. 

Assuming 1e18 will cause precision loss when `convertToShares()` and `convertToAssets()` functions are used for WBTC and USDC on ARBITRUM. (there will be a deployment on Arbitrum soon)

## Impact
precision loss when `convertToShares()` and `convertToAssets()` functions are used for WBTC and USDC on ARBITRUM.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
re-work the exchangeRate to work with token WBTC's 8 decimals and USDC 6 decimals(i.e when its ARBITRUM).PRAISE
