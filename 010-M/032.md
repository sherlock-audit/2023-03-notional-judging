# rebalance would fail if any external market of the same underlying fails to redeem.

## Summary
rebalance would fail if any external market of the same underlying fails to redeem.

## Vulnerability Detail
call stack:

`TreasuryAction::rebalance` -> `_rebalanceCurrency` -> `_executeRebalance` -> `TokenHandler::executeMoneyMarketRedemptions`

Even though rebalance can take any number of currencies to execute rebalance, `executeMoneyMarketRedemptions` actually execute all necessary redemption in a for loop. that means if any 1 market pauses, all currencies in the system fails to be rebalanced.

For example, let's say there is market A, B, C, D each has 100 tokens (equal price) - 25% each

1. the target is now updated to A: 40 B:40 C:10 D:10
2. market C unfortunately went into an emergency pause.
3. we call `rebalance` with only market A
4. C and D would require a redemption, each for 15 tokens.
5. since withdrawal from C would revert, executeMoneyMarketRedemptions fails even though market D works fine

## Impact
any market pause would paralyse rebalancing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
create more granular entry point for individual market deposit / redemption to mitigate impact of a single market failure
