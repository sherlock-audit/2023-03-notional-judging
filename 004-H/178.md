# Settlement process brings debt below `minBorrowSize`

## Summary

The settlement process can leave some accounts below the minimum debt. Thus, leaving accounts with small debt that are not profitable to unwind if it needs to liquidate.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultAccount.sol#L457

```solidity
File: VaultAccount.sol
454:         // Calculates the net settled cash if there is any temp cash balance that is net off
455:         // against the settled prime debt.
456:         bool didTransferPrimary;
457:         (accountPrimeStorageValue, didTransferPrimary) = repayAccountPrimeDebtAtSettlement(
458:             vaultConfig.primeRate,
459:             primeVaultState,
460:             vaultConfig.borrowCurrencyId,
461:             vaultConfig.vault,
462:             vaultAccount.account,
463:             vaultAccount.tempCashBalance,
464:             accountPrimeStorageValue
465:         );
466:         // Clear any temp cash balance, it has been applied to the debt
467:         vaultAccount.tempCashBalance = 0;
```

During vault account settlement, the temporary cash will be automatically used to offset the primary and/or secondary debt, which might push the debt below the minimum borrow size.

Assume that the vault account debt is `-100`, the `minBorrowSize` is `50`, and the `tempCashBalance` is `70`. During the settlement, the debt will be offset by the `tempCashBalance`. As such, after the settlement, the account debt will be `30`, which is below the `minBorrowSize`.

## Impact

The settlement process can leave some accounts below the minimum debt. Accounts smaller than the minimum debt are not profitable to unwind if it needs to liquidate [(Reference)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultAccount.sol#L329)

As a result, liquidators are not incentivized to liquidate those undercollateralized positions. This might leave the protocol with bad debts, potentially leading to insolvency if the bad debts accumulate.

## Recommendation

Considering repaying or offsetting the debt up to the `minBorrowSize`.
