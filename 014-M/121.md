# router.sol won't be able to re-route calls to some functions in nTokenAction.sol

## Summary
the require statements in some functions in nTokenAction.sol will make re-routing calls in the router.sol to it via the fallback() function fail. 

## Vulnerability Detail
some functions in nTokenAction.sol has this require statement which is implemented as Access control
```solidity
        require(msg.sender == nTokenAddress);
```
and 
```solidity
        require(msg.sender == pCashAddress);
```

Now the above require statement will make any call to this functions that isn't from the nTokenAddress or pCashAddress to fail.

And fallback() function in router.sol makes a call to these functions here:
```solidity
    fallback() external payable {
        _delegate(getRouterImplementation(msg.sig));
    }
```

and the fallback function uses `getRouterImplementation()` function to return the implementation contract for the method signature to call, and the following functions are among the sig:

nTokenTransferApprove
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.nTokenTransferApprove.selector 
```

 pCashTransferApprove
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.pCashTransferApprove.selector 
```

nTokenTransfer
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.nTokenTransfer.selector 
```

pCashTransfer
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.pCashTransfer.selector 
```

nTokenTransferFrom
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.nTokenTransferFrom.selector
```


PCashTransferFrom
```solidity
            sig == nTokenERC20.pCashTransferFrom.selector
```
So re-routing calls to these functions via the fallback functions will fail as the require statement will fail.

## Impact
So re-routing calls to these functions via the fallback functions will fail as the require statement will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To interact with these functions from the router.sol contract, you would need to use a different approach. One possible solution is to have a separate function in the nToken contract that allows the router.sol contract to approve transfers on behalf of the nToken and pCash contracts. This separate function could include additional access control checks to ensure that only authorized contracts, such as the router.sol contract, can call it.
