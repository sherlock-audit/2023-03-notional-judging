# PauseRouter.sol won't be able to re-route calls to some functions in VaultAccountHealth.sol

## Summary
the require statements in some functions in VaultAccountHealth.sol, will make re-routing calls in the PauseRouter.sol to it via the fallback() function fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
functions like calculateDepositAmountInDeleverage() function in VaultAccountHealth.sol has this require statement implemented for access control
```solidity
        require(msg.sender == address(this)); // dev: unauthorized
```

now attempting to make a call to it via PauseRouter.sol's `fallback()` function here will fail
```solidity
 fallback() external payable {
        _delegate(getRouterImplementation(msg.sig));
    }
```



## Impact
 re-routing calls to thisfunction via the fallback functions will fail as the require statement will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To interact with this function from the PauseRouter.sol contract, you would need to use a different approach. One possible solution is to have a separate function in the VaultAccountHealth.sol that allows the PauseRouter.sol contract to calculate deposit amount in deleverage. This separate function could include additional access control checks to ensure that only authorized contracts, such as the PauseRouter.sol contract, can call it.
