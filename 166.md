# Exceeding Gas Limit in Token Transfer

## Summary
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/liquidators/NotionalV2ManualLiquidator.sol#L54)
The contract `NotionalV2ManualLiquidator` uses the `transferOwnership` function to transfer ownership and grant the `ADMIN_ROLE` to a new owner. However, this function sequence may exceed the gas limit due to the cumulative gas cost of native token transfers. This report highlights a potential vulnerability and provides recommendations for mitigating the issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs in the `transferOwnership` function of the `NotionalV2ManualLiquidator` contract. The function attempts to transfer ownership to a new owner and grant the `ADMIN_ROLE` to them. However, if the cumulative gas cost of the function sequence, including native token transfers, exceeds the 2300 gas limit, the transaction will fail, and the ownership transfer will not be completed successfully.

## Impact
This vulnerability can prevent the successful transfer of ownership and grant of the `ADMIN_ROLE` in the `NotionalV2ManualLiquidator` contract. The failure to complete the ownership transfer can lead to administrative control being retained by the previous owner, potentially impacting the proper functioning of the contract and its associated operations.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
    owner = newOwner;
    // Make new user the USER_ROLE admin
    grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, newOwner);
    revokeRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is recommended to consider the following recommendations:

Evaluate the gas consumption of the function sequence invoked in the `transferOwnership` function, including native token transfers. If the cumulative gas cost exceeds the 2300 gas limit, alternative approaches should be considered to ensure the successful completion of the ownership transfer.

One possible solution is to use the `call` function with an increased gas limit for the token transfer.
    Here's of how you could modify the `transferOwnership` function to use the call function with an increased gas limit for the token transfer:

```solidity
    function `transferOwnership`(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
    require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
    owner = newOwner;

    // Make new user the USER_ROLE admin
    bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("grantRole(bytes32,address)", `ADMIN_ROLE`, newOwner);
    (bool success, ) = address(this).call{gas: 30000}(payload);
    require(success, "Granting `ADMIN_ROLE` failed");

    // Revoke `ADMIN_ROLE` from the current owner
    payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("revokeRole(bytes32,address)", `ADMIN_ROLE`, msg.sender);
    (success, ) = address(this).call{gas: 30000}(payload);
    require(success, "Revoking `ADMIN_ROLE` failed");
}
```

In this, the grantRole and revokeRole functions are called using the call function with an increased gas limit of 30,000. This should provide enough gas for the token transfer and the execution of these functions, ensuring that the ownership transfer and role assignment can be completed successfully.
