# Lack of Input Validation for blockTime Parameter

## Summary

There is a lack of input validation for the blockTime parameter in several functions, which could potentially lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail

The blockTime parameter is used in multiple functions, such as getfCashLendFromDeposit, getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal, getDepositFromfCashLend, and getPrincipalFromfCashBorrow. There is no validation to ensure that blockTime is less than or equal to the current block.timestamp, which could lead to unexpected results.

## Impact

Using a future blockTime could result in incorrect calculations and potential financial losses for users.

## Recommendation

Add input validation to ensure that blockTime is less than or equal to the current block.timestamp in all relevant functions.
