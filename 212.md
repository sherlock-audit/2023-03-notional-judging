# No minimum borrow size check against secondary debts

## Summary

Secondary debts were not checked against the minimum borrow size during exit, which could lead to accounts with insufficient debt becoming insolvent and the protocol incurring bad debts.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional-0xleastwood/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/vaults/VaultAccount.sol#L140

```solidity
File: VaultAccount.sol
121:     function _setVaultAccount(
..SNIP..
130:         // An account must maintain a minimum borrow size in order to enter the vault. If the account
131:         // wants to exit under the minimum borrow size it must fully exit so that we do not have dust
132:         // accounts that become insolvent.
133:         if (
134:             vaultAccount.accountDebtUnderlying.neg() < vaultConfig.minAccountBorrowSize &&
135:             // During local currency liquidation and settlement, the min borrow check is skipped
136:             checkMinBorrow
137:         ) {
138:             // NOTE: use 1 to represent the minimum amount of vault shares due to rounding in the
139:             // vaultSharesToLiquidator calculation
140:             require(vaultAccount.accountDebtUnderlying == 0 || vaultAccount.vaultShares <= 1, "Min Borrow");
141:         }
```

A vault account has one primary debt (`accountDebtUnderlying`) and one or more secondary debts (`accountDebtOne` and `accountDebtTwo`).

When a vault account exits the vault, Notional will check that its primary debt (`accountDebtUnderlying`) meets the minimum borrow size requirement. If a vault account wants to exit under the minimum borrow size it must fully exit so that we do not have dust accounts that become insolvent. This check is being performed in Line 140 above.

However, this check is not performed against the secondary debts. As a result, it is possible that the secondary debts fall below the minimum borrow size after exiting.

## Impact

Vault accounts with debt below the minimum borrow size are at risk of becoming insolvent, leaving the protocol with bad debts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider performing a similar check against the secondary debts (`accountDebtOne` and `accountDebtTwo`) within the `_setVaultAccount` function to ensure they do not fall below the minimum borrow size.
